\section{Conclusion}
In this work we presented a set of functionalities that a fleet-level communication pipeline should exhibit
such that we can improve the safety of self-driving vehicles while minimizing the impact on on-board computers
and network infrastructures.
Tests on a realistic model of a town show that our communication strategy can reduce the number of
collisions by about $\collision_ratio_reduction_perc\%$.
Our model could be improved by giving the vehicles the ability to discard messages that are not relevant
to their current paths or the ability to re-plan so that the danger is avoided.
