    \caption{3D view of Duckietown (no simulation) showing vehicles stopping in line without colliding
    due to an accident located at the North-East 3-way intersection ($POI$).
    The \textit{yellow} circles indicate the position of the vehicles after they stopped. 
    The \textit{blue} circles indicate their communication ranges. The \textit{red} cylinders 
    indicate the location advertised by the vehicles as \textit{dangerous}. The small \textit{blue boxes} 
    indicate that a vehicle is broadcasting messages about known dangerous locations.  \label{fig:3d_viewer_full_model}}
