Data Challenges

Using the 19 RSS trace files given to us, we were able to extract
the RSS values from known devices and calculate the absolute distance to
a known location. The challenge is that this data is extremely noisy, with
almost all of the RSS values having a possible distance ranging from 2 meters
to 10 meters. This could be due to multi-path effects that alter the trajectory
of the signals. In order to properly fit a curve over our data to predict
distance based on RSS values, we need to reduce to noise in our data and find
data points that are an accurate representation of the RSS versus distance
relationship.

Data Processing

In order to extract a RSS versus distance relationship from our traces, we begin
by calculating the known distances for the RSS values for which we know where
the position of the device is. Taking this data, we then take the moving
average of the RSS and distance values. This is to reduce the amount of noise
that we see in the data. We then take each of the RSS values and bucket their
distance values with a granularity of half a meter, this will allow us to ignore
outliers that are incorrect and focus in on only the data points that accurately
represent the distance relationship. Finally we can fit a polynomial curve
over the data points to help map distance when given only RSS for the traces
where we do not know the correct position.
